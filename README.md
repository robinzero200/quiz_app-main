# quiz_app

### A key concept of the course Advanced Programming Concepts (APC) is Object Oriented programming (OOP). In celebration of this, our team was given to complete a project utilizing the OOP principles we learnt over the course. The goal of this project is to implement concrete, real-world objects (i.e: humans, animals, buildings, shapes etc), structure relations between the different objects, and organizing functionality accordingly.

### Here we are developping a quiz game based on questions of different categories (i.e: history, politics, economics etc), keep track of the user/s performance, prioritize categories where the user performs poorly  etc. We have yet to decide what other functionalities will be implemented. We are using _*TKINTER*_ package for the GUI (Graphical User Interface).The _*TKINTER*_ package is Python's de-facto standard GUI package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one.
